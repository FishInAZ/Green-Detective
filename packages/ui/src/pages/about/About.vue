      <b>"Avalon: The Resistance"</b> is a captivating board game of strategy and deception, set in the legendary era of
      King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Designed for 5 to 10 players, it invites you into a divided world
      where you're either a loyal servant of Arthur striving to protect the kingdom or a devious minion of Mordred
      plotting its downfall. The game is celebrated for its incorporation of secret identities, strategic deception, and
      the deductive challenge of discerning allies from foes.
